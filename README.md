## üì• Clone Project

To clone the project to your computer, run the following command line:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jcalvoq/thesisPINN
```

To validate that the project has been cloned correctly, run the following commands to verify that you have the latest version of the project:

```bash
cd thesisPINN
git status
```

## üêç Virtual Environment Creation

To run the project, the native Python `venv` option was used. First, navigate to your project folder.

If you want to do it manually, you can create it with the following commands. It's recommended to create this environment in the project folder:

```bash
cd C:\path\to\project
python -m venv <Virtual_Environment_Name>
```

To activate the environment, use the following command:

```bash
# Windows
.\Virtual_Environment_Name\Scripts\activate

#Linux
source Virtual_Environment_Name/bin/activate
```

To deactivate the virtual environment, use the command:

```bash
deactivate
```

## üì¶ Dependency Installation

To install the necessary dependencies, you can use the command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Use

For the correct usage of this code it is necessary to first run the Python file named after the differential equation, which saves the weights and the values of the loss function in storage. If it is desired to plot the approximations use the plot Python file, which will compare the approximations to Euler's or RK4 method. If it is desired to plot the values of the loss function use the plot loss Python file.

**Example usage:**

For the example corresponding to the exponential equation with delay first run this Python file

```bash
python ExpDelay/ExponentialDelay.py
```

For plotting the solutions use the following file

```bash
python ExpDelay/plotDDE.py
```

For plotting the loss function values throughout the runtime use the following file

```bash
python ExpDelay/plotLoss.py
```
